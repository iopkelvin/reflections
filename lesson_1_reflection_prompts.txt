How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I can observe the difference between both files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can see the history which includes changes and bug fixes. It helps plan ahead.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
I can see it online, offline, and I can manually save, so I decide when to commit and see the most important changes without including redundant changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It allows to keep track of multiple files working along together, so each commit differentiates changes of files that might work together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
first, I need to change directory to the file. Then git log to see the history of commits. Then git diff to view the changes between two commits
