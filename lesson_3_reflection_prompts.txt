When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I don't have my local files with me, and I'm using a remote browser/computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I want to be aware of all the changes and updated to my files, and if Git does it manually, then that would create confusions for me.
